    "Data is often stored in formats that are not easy to read unless you have some specialised software. Excel spreadsheets are one example; how do you read an Excel spreadsheet if you don't have Excel? This reliance on particular software is not very useful for programmatic analysis of data. Instead if we're going to use a programming language to analyse or process our data we would prefer some \"easy to deal with\" format. Text files or [flatfiles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file) provide just the sort of format we need (there are other choices). You can think of these as a single sheet from a spreadsheet with the data arranged in rows (separated by our old friend the ```\\n``` character) and columns (separated by some other character)."

Other separators in text files of data may be little used characters such as '|', ':' or spaces.

We can do this using base python but it's easier if we use a python **library**, in this case the [```csv```](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/systems-programming/using-the-csv-module-in-python/) library. We'll learn more about libraries in the next unit but for now just consider libraries as extra python code that you can get access to if you need it. In fact that's exactly what many libraries are. So the quesion arises 'how do we get access to a library?'. We have to tell python we want to use the library up front. To do this we use the ```import``` statement."
